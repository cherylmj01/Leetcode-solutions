Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository, a personal project designed to demystify algorithm challenges and provide clear, detailed explanations for each solution. My name is Cheryl Myers, and I'm passionate about coding, problem-solving, and helping others on their journey to becoming proficient software developers.

### Why I Started This Project

As someone who has navigated the complexities of learning algorithms and preparing for technical interviews, I understand how daunting it can be to approach problem-solving without the right guidance. This project was born out of my desire to create a resource that not only showcases solutions but also delves into the thought processes behind them, offering readers a deeper understanding of the logic and strategies needed to tackle similar problems.

### What You'll Find Here

On this site, you'll find a curated collection of LeetCode problems that I've personally solved, accompanied by comprehensive explanations and code snippets. Each post is designed to be both informative and accessible, breaking down complex concepts into manageable pieces of information. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with coding challenges or an experienced coder seeking to refine your skills, there's something here for you.

### My Approach

My approach to solving LeetCode problems is methodical, focusing on understanding the fundamentals and exploring various solutions. I believe in learning by doing, which means you'll see a range of techniques and algorithms applied across different problems. My goal is to provide clear, concise, and correct solutions that not only solve the problem at hand but also teach something valuable along the way.

### Connect With Me

I'm always looking to connect with fellow coding enthusiasts and learners. If you have questions, suggestions, or simply want to discuss coding and problem-solving strategies, feel free to reach out. Your feedback is invaluable as it helps me improve this resource and make it more useful for everyone.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the solutions and explanations helpful on your coding journey!
